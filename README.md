# Tron
We can play the light-motorcycle battle (known from the Tron
movie) in a top view. Two players play against each other with two motors, where each
motor leaves a light trace behind of itself on the display. The motor goes in each seconds
toward the direction, that the player has set recently. The first player can use the WASD
keyboard buttons, while the second one can use the cursor buttons for steering.
A player loses if its motor goes to the boundary of the game level, or it goes to the light
trace of the other player. The name of the players has to be entered before the game starts, and they
can choose the color their light traces. The game increase the counter of the winner by one in the
database at the end of the game. If the player does not exit in the database yet, then insert
a record for him. The menu item, which displays a highscore table of the players for
the 10 best scores.
